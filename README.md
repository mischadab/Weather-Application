For this assignment, we were asked to create a Weather Dashboard. 
In the weather dashboard, we needed to include a search bar that functions, and searches for weather in the specified city. 
We linked an API key that called for the weather for specified city.
After searching for a city, the city is listed underneath the search bar for later reference.
The weather appears with the current date, temp, etc, followed by a 5 day forecast underneath.
